# Machine Learning Experiments
Adventures in Machine Learning!!!
<br>
I am using numpy and following tuts from [iamtrask](http://iamtrask.github.io/)
<br>
## First Generation
Converts iamtrask's 2 layer neural net into a class.
## Second Generation
Provides a basic scalable class to create a backpropagation net with nothing fancy in terms of optimisation.
