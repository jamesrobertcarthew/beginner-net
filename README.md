# Machine Learning Experiments
Adventures in Machine Learning!!!

## First Generation
Converts [iamtrask](http://iamtrask.github.io/)'s 2 layer neural net into a class.
---
## Second Generation
Provides a basic scalable class to create a backpropagation net with nothing fancy in terms of optimisation. Python Pickle lets me save and load the self.synapse values. Input, Desired Output and Layer count can be set to different dimensions and values (within reason).
